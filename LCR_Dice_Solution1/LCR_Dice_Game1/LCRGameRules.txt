Welcome Player to Left Center Right Game!

Left Center Right (LCR) is a multiplayer dice game with a minimum of three-player, but no more on the number of participants. The goal is to win all of the chips.


There three dice that roll each turn.  Each die has the letters L, C, and R on the side. 
On the three remaining sides are dots. These dice determine where the player chips will go. 

The Dice

For each L, the player must pass one chip to the player's sitting to the left.
For each R, the player must pass one chip to the player's sitting to the Right.
For each C, the player must place one chip into the center pot, and those chips are now outplaying.

The Chips

Each player will start with three chips.
If a player only has one chip, he/she rolls only one die.
If a player has two chips left, he/she rolls two dice. 
Once a player is out of chips, he/she is still in the game (as he/she may get chips passed to him/her) but passes the dice to the next player.

Winning the Game

The winner is the last player with chips.
